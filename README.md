## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Create Google Sheet
- Go to [Google Sheets](https://sheets.google.com)
- Create a new blank spreadsheet
- Copy the spreadsheet URL

### 2. Deploy Google Apps Script
1. In your sheet: **Extensions → Apps Script**
2. Delete default code
3. Copy entire content from `google-script.gs`
4. Update these lines at the top:
   ```javascript
   const ADMIN_KEY = 'GENERATE_RANDOM_KEY_HERE';
   const USER_KEY = 'GENERATE_RANDOM_KEY_HERE';
   const ADMIN_NAME = 'Your Name'; // Admin participant name
   ```
5. **Save** (Ctrl/Cmd + S)
6. **Deploy → New deployment**
   - Type: **Web app**
   - Execute as: **Me**
   - Who has access: **Anyone**
   - Click **Deploy**
7. Copy the **Web App URL** (you'll need this next)

### 3. Generate Access Keys & Links
1. Open `setup.html` in your browser
2. Fill in:
   - **Group Name** (e.g., "Sabarimala 2026")
   - **Google Sheet URL** (from step 1)
   - **Apps Script URL** (Web App URL from step 2)
3. Click **🎲 Generate Random Keys**
4. Copy both keys and update them in Apps Script:
   - Replace `ADMIN_KEY = 'GENERATE_RANDOM_KEY_HERE'`
   - Replace `USER_KEY = 'GENERATE_RANDOM_KEY_HERE'`
5. **Redeploy** the script:
   - **Deploy → Manage deployments**
   - Click **Edit** (pencil icon)
   - **Version**: New version
   - Click **Deploy**
6. Back in `setup.html`, click **🔗 Generate Encrypted Links**
7. Copy the links:
   - **Admin Link** - Keep this private (full control)
   - **User Link** - Share with your group members

### 4. Start Using
- Open your **admin link** and verify it works
- Share the **user link** with group members
- Users register themselves, you approve them
- Users can then submit expenses for your approval

## 📊 How It Works

```
User Flow:
1. User opens shared link → Registers with name
2. Admin approves registration → User gets access
3. User submits expense → Marked as "Pending"
4. Admin reviews → Can edit details if needed
5. Admin approves → Expense added to calculations
6. Everyone sees updated settlements

Admin Flow:
- Direct access to all features
- No registration needed
- Can perform all user actions plus management
- Admin link auto-saved in Google Sheets on first load
```

| **Settlements** | Confirmed payment records |
| **Registrations** | Pending registration requests |
| **UserLinks** | Backup of all generated access links |
